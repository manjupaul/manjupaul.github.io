I am a Software Test Engineer. But in fact, I am a Developer, a Tester, and a User, at least that is how I evolved over time. I am a Software Developer focused on Quality! is just another way to put it. I started this blog to capture my thoughts, notes and other things to ponder.

Most of the time I have no much idea on what I am jotting down, so you should take everything on this site with a grain of salt! :-).

I do believe that mistakes are opportunities to learn, I take criticisms positively. Please do let me know if you find something wrong in my posts.
