Will a software testing certification guarantee you a better salary? No. Will it guarantee better job prospects? No. Is earning a certification worth it? Absolutely!, if you are unemployed and have a gap in your career. I recently obtained my Agile Tester Foundation Level. While preparing for it I got an oportunity to get hands on on various new process areas in quality assurance arena.

The follwing diagram shows the various certifications offered by ISTQB foundation:

Obtaining an ISTQB certification – or any IT certification for that matter – does not equate to an employment guarantee or a higher salary. It does, however, broaden your career horizons and open up the potential for increased salary and higher profile roles. The intangible benefits alone make studying for the exam worthwhile, and at $250 USD, the Foundation Level test is relatively inexpensive investment in your career.
